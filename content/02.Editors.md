# Editors

Code editors provide tools to create, edit, and save plain text files. Compared to word processors, they lack the tools for formatting the text. On top of that, most code editors offer additional features, such as:

- syntax highlighting - presenting commands and comments in different colours
- syntax checking - highlighting coding errors
- code completion - auto-completing certain tags
- automatic code formatting - code indentation
- powerful text manipulation and scrolling tools

Some code editors or IDEs only offer the additional features for one or a few programming language. For example, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a full-featured IDE for Python that also supports Python debugging and source control. A number of code editors also provide a file explorer that allows you navigate through the files and directories of your project and manage them effectively. Compared to an IDE, code editors are usually smaller and quicker, but often less feature rich.

Some general purpose code editors are:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) aka VS Code is an open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is the most full featured code-editor in this list, closest to an IDE. VS Code is robust, but consumes more resources compared to other light-weight editors. VS Code has many built-in features and is very extensible, making it a popular choice for beginner programmers.

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) is called the "hackable text editor for the 21st Century" and is developed by GitHub, thus offering easy built-in integration with Git and GitHub. It is fast, small, and open-source, supports all platforms, and provides a marketplace for extensions.

- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) is a free, simple, and efficient code editor that supports Microsoft Windows. It is a good alternative for users who need additional features but enjoy the look and feel of Notepad.

- [Vi/Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is an old text editor that is included by default on almost every UNIX system and macOS X. Vi/Vim are modal editors, separating the viewing of a file from the editing of a file, and since it is a command line software, has a steep learning curve. If you learn how to operate it, it is a much faster and more efficient choice than code editors with graphical user interface. 

- [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) is another command line code editor. Nano user interface is much simpler than Vim and is a perfect choice for editing codes on a remote machine.

## Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are first built for Python development, as a learning tools accessible as a web application. They provide an easy-to-use and interactive environment and are currently available across various programming languages. They support Markdown, allowing you to add comments and reports to the code. You can export the code or the report later. While they are a good choice for testing ideas or developing small projects, they are not suitable for building biggger projects.

[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/) is a free and online tool built by Google that offers free CPU and GPU for developing Python code in Jupyter Notebooks. It is a great choice for beginners to learn Python development or run small projects and access them on all their devices.
