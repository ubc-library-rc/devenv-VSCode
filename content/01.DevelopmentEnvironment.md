# Integrated Development Environment

Coding can be as simple as opening a notepad file and typing the commands. However, it is not a convenient solution for many even professional developers. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are created to make the process easier by combining a set of tools to write, compile, debug, and test the codes in a single environment. The actual makeup of an IDE depends on the programming language, type of projects, and your needs, bu there are some things that are common among a lot of IDEs, such as:

- Code editor
- Command-line interface (CLI) - build, execution, and debugging tools
- Version control system
- Package manager

You can also find IDEs available for different scenarios, where these four components, and probably many more tools, are combined already and will be available upon installation. However, starting with simple development tools help you to learn the basics quickly and build your own developing environment based on your needs.

In the next sections of this workshop, we learn about different parts of an IDE with a focus on Visual Studio Code as a code editor with many extra features.
