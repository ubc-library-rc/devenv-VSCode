# Setting Up a Development Environment

## Note: this workshop is in development and not yet complete.

While many argue that the best way to learn to code is to simply start coding, having the right set of tools makes coding much more enjoyable and productive. In this workshop, we explore the differences between development environments and basic text editors and we will set up a simple development environment using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Moreover, this workshop introduces VSCode extensions, such as Git, SSH, and Docker, and gives you resources to learn more about them.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Recognize the role and purpose of a development environment and editor in computer programming
2. Become familiar with the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) interface and tools
3. Employ Extensions to connect Visual Studio Code with other development tools such as SSH, Git, and Docker

## Before the workshop

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your system

- Install a [Python Interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-a-python-interpreter) on your system. We will use Python programming language to show language-specific capabilities of a development environmet such as VS Code

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and take a look at the [Introduction to Git](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/) workshop
