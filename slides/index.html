            <h4>An introduction to Visual Studio Code</h4>


            <aside class="notes">

                Hello everyone, Welcome to this workshop which aims to support you to get familiar with coding environments and
                setup your personal environment for development of codes. This workshop is built for people who are fairly familiar with coding 
                but would like to improve their knowledge about the tools and processes that improves their productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                My name is Shayan Fahimi. I am a PhD student in structural engineering. I used programming during the last ten years, for university projects and industry but never 
                had a software developer role. Thus, in this workshop, I mainly focus on the points that you need to get the job done and build a robust tool for developing, maintaining, and testing your 
                programming projects.
                </p>

                This workshop starts by introducing the concept of development environment.
                Then, we talk about code editors and among those, we choose VSCode to dive deeper
                and learn about their abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                After that, we talk also about terminal, source control, virtualization, and community.
                The later sections are also guides to use other workshops presented by the 
                UBC library commons.

            <h2>What is a Development Environment?</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
                Coding can be as simple as opening a notepad file and typing the commands. However, it is not a convenient solution for many even professional developers. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are created to make the process easier by combining a set of tools to write, compile, debug, and test the codes in a single environment. While these tools make life much easier, they can be very complicated.    
                Ask them what is a development environment and if they have any installed on their machine right now

            <h3>What is a Development Environment?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Code editor</li>
                <li>Command line interface (CLI)</li>
                <li>Version control system</li>
                <li>Package manager</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
            <p>
            Development environments have four main components: 
            </p> 
            <p>
            code editor is a simple text editor program designed for editing source codes on your machines.
            A command line interface processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The lines of texts are interpreted by this program and then sent for execution. Windows command prompt and linux terminal are two examples.
            Like programming languages, we have command line languages, such as bash or zsh, which are also called shell in Unix. 
            A version control system is responsible for managing changes to a computer programs, documents, or generally collections of information. Git and Subversion are two main free version control systems used by developers right now.
            and a package manager or package management system automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing programs from your machine. Windows has a package manager, some linux distributions has a package manager called apt, python has a package manager called pip
            and some development environment has exclusive package managers such as conda.
            </p>
            </aside>

        <section style="text-align: left;">
            <h3>Editors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>syntax highlighting</li>
                <li>syntax checking</li>
                <li>code completion</li>
                <li>automatic code formatting</li>
                <li>powerful text manipulation and scrolling tools</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
            <p>
            Code editors provide tools to create, edit, and save plain text files. Compared to word processors, they lack the tools for formatting the text. On top of that, most code editors offer additional features, such as:
            </p>
            <p>
            syntax highlighting, which displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts. This feature helps you to quickly differentiate logical expression from function definitions and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
            Syntax checking highlights the errors and sometimes irregular programming styles to improve the functionality and quality of your code.
            </p>
            <p>
            Code completion is useful for quickly writing an script or function without fully typing all the lines. It also helps with writing the variable or function names and reduces spelling errors.
            </p>
            <p>
            Automatic code formatting is an advanced tool that formats your code to follow the accepted style and format. It facilitates collaboration and maintanenace of your code.
            </p>
            and finally you will find advanced text manipulation and scrolling which accelerates search and replace tasks or when you want to add or delete a certain character in multiple lines.

            There are many different code editors in the market. Among the ones shown in this list, Notepad and notepad++ are for Windows. Atom is a free and open source 
            code editor available for all operating systems. It is developed by Github. 
            </p>
            <p> 
            Vim and Nano are free and open source but only available for Unix like systems. Both of them are available in the terminal, thus, while they are very popular 
            among professional users, they have a steep learning curve. Nano is more user friendly than Vim but still does not provide a full graphical user interface. 
            We will learn today how to use Visual Studio Code graphical user interface on remote servers, which can substitute some use cases of Nano and Vim.

            Jupyter notebooks are first built for Python development, as a learning tools accessible as a web application. 
            They provide an easy-to-use and interactive environment and are currently available across various programming languages. They support Markdown, allowing you to add comments and reports to the code. You can export the code or the report later. While they are a good choice for testing ideas or developing small projects, they are not suitable for building biggger projects.

            Visual Studio Code is a simple text editor with some powerful IDE-like features. It is a separate product from Visual Studio, Microsoft's full-featured and well-known IDE. 
            While VS Code is only a couple of hundred megabytes and is free, Visual Studio is at least several Gigabytes and it is not free. VS Code is also open-source and is easy to customize. 
            You can quickly set keybindings and syntax highlightings based on the programming language you are using and your experience. Moreover, it has a built-in file explorer,
            source control, terminal, remote explorer, and supports extensions that add greats capabilities.

                    Linting is the process of checking the code for syntactical and stylistic errors. The extension you installed also uses a linter, PyLint, that highlights problems in your source code. For example, it detects uninitialized or undefined variables, calls to undefined functions, missing parantheses, using unimported libraries and much more.

                    Formatting helps people to read the code easier by applying rules and conventions for line spacing, indents, spacing around operators and much more. The changes applied to the code by formatting does not change the functionality of the code. Formatters also known as beautifiers or indenters.

                    Unit testing is a software testing method in which you test specific pieces of code, also known as units, automatically and with a full range of different inputs, including boundary and edge cases. Unit tests are concerned only with the inputs and outputs of a unit, not with its implementation. To thoroughly test a function, you want to throw every conceivable input at it. For each input, you define the function’s expected return value.
